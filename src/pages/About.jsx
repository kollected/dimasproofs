    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Hey! My name is Dima, nice to sort of meet you. I'm a frontend developer and since you're here, I'm probably
      looking for work.</p>
    <p>This place right here is essentially my digital resume. It is here for you to get a sense of what I do as a
      programmer and who I am as a person.</p>
    <p>For optimal experience, I recommend keeping your browser console open at all times, as I often use
      a <code>console.log</code> to track various actions. I also left a bunch of comments in the code.</p>
    <p>I would also like to mention that while I take my work seriously, this was done just a bit tongue-in-cheek. Feel
      free to poke around and explore but don't take it too seriously.</p>
    <h3>My experience</h3>
