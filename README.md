hey! this project is essentially my digital cv/portfolio. it is a barebones demonstration of my knowledge and coding ability. 

this is a work in progress. more pages will be added when i get to adding them.

to start the project locally, run `npm run dev` and `node src/server.cjs` in the terminal. 

# React + Vite
